# PushupPullupRecord
A program to keep track of the progress of pushups and pullups performed.  Currently developing.
Excercise.py contains the exercises to be performed and which day they will be perfomred on.  The code will read which
day it is on DayFile.txt and will activate the excerises of the day based on that information.  Once the exercise is performed,
the program will write the exercies to a csv file, then overwirte DayFile.txt so that the program will know which exercises
to perfom the next time it is run.
